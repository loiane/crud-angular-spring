## ❗️Excuting the code locally

### Executing the back-end

You need to have Java and Maven installed and configured locally.

Open the `crud-spring` project in your favorite IDE as a Maven project and execute it as Spring Boot application.

### Executing the front-end

You need to have Node.js / NPM installed locally.

1) Install all the required depencencies:

```
npm install
```

2) Execute the project:

```
npm run start
```

This command will run the Angular project with a proxy to the Java server, without requiring CORS.

Open your browser and access **http://localhost:4200** (Angular default port).
